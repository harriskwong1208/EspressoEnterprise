EspressoEnterprise is an analysis of a coffee sales dataset, incorporating order, customer, and product data, utilizing Excel. The project includes the creation of a dynamic dashboard featuring interactive visualizations such as line and bar charts. These visualizations provide insights into total sales trends over time, top customers and their sales figures, and sales breakdowns by country. The dashboard is enhanced with a timeline and slicers, allowing users to dynamically explore and visualize data based on various filters such as time period, customer loyalty status, coffee roast type, and size.
